# EHGG (Enhanced Human Generator for Godot)
(This project is NOT related for MakeHuman or Godot)
## My commentary

Since **Humanizer gone AGPL** (because of copying MakeHuman code, so **previous versions are affected too**),
I decided to do a permissively licensed human generator for Godot.

~~I need this for Internal Eternal Demo 2, because it was using Humanizer~~

As a base, I forked MIT-licensed repo (see [License](./LICENSE.txt) for more information).

## Original repo readme text

This is an in-progress 3D character creation suite for Godot 4.x (tested on 4.4).

Currently, only female is available.

Contributors are welcome.

### Basic How-to:
The project contains two folders, one for the godot projct and a Source folder containing the blender files and textures.
> Yni's comment - I re-organize dirs to my standard layout.

# TODO / Roadmap:

- Redo all the blendshapes to make them more realistic (contributors needed for this)
- Add some basic clothing? might be out of scope but a rudimentary clothing or equipment system might be useful.
- Add more hairstyles (and fix the hair physics, it looks wierd right now)
- Add male gender
- Improve the aging texture
